# Data-Cleaning-and-Pipeline-Creation-NBA-Play-by-Play-Data

### Description and motivation:
This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and ETL pipeline creation using Python: and specifically the Pandas library. 

The motivating question behind this project was what are the most efficient types of shots in basketball. The secondary goal was to build a profile of the shots (whether it be the shot distance, shot type, etc.) that teams in the NBA take. This is first and foremost a data cleaning project, and the majority of the work will be done preparing the data to answer these questions; with a secondary focus on exploring the questions themselves (which have already been explored in depth). 
To follow along with this project for yourself, open the “Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation” Jupyter Notebook in this repository.

### Project process:
The data being used is five similarly formatted csv files (each containing Play-by-Play data for a different NBA season), which I'll build a data pipeline for, then combine to perform further analysis on.
The Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation file is the code used to clean the data and resulting outputs. The CSV file demonstrates the data used for this project.
