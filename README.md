# Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation, NBA Play-by-Play Data.

### Description and motivation:
This project showcases my proficiency in data cleaning and ETL pipeline creation using Python: specifically the Pandas library. 

The motivating question behind this project was what are the most efficient types of shots in basketball. The secondary question/goal was to build a profile of the shots (whether it be the shot distance, shot type, etc.) that teams in the NBA take. This is first and foremost a data cleaning project, and the majority of the work will be done preparing the data to answer these questions; with a secondary focus on exploring the questions themselves (which have already been researched in depth). 

### Data and Executing for Yourself:
The data being used is five similarly formatted csv files (each containing Play-by-Play data for a different NBA season).
The 2000-01_pbp_demo.csv file demonstrates the raw data used for this project.

To follow along with this project for yourself, open the “Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation” Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
