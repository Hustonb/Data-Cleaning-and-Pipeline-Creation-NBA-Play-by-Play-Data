# Data-Cleaning-and-Pipeline-Creation-NBA-Play-by-Play-Data

This repository contains files associated with my "Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation, NBA Play by Play Data." This project served to gain insight into the most efficient types of shots in basketball. The second goal is to build a profile of the shots (whether it be the shot distance, shot type, etc.) that teams in the NBAtake. This is first and foremost a data cleaning project, and the majority of the work will be done preparing the data to answer these questions; with a secondary focus on exploring the questions themselves. The data being used is five similarly formatted csv files (each containing Play-by-Play data for a different NBA season), which I'll build a data pipeline for, then combine to perform further analysis on. 

The Data Cleaning and Pipeline Creation file is the code used to clean the data and resulting outputs. The CSV file demonstrates the data used for this project.
